The mustard package is written for python 3, and is not compatible with python 2. Note that this means that macOS systems will need to installed python 3, as Apple is still shipping python 2 as of June 2019.

The mustard.py module requires that numpy be available. It does not need GPU integration, and only makes use of basic vector operations.

The command line tool to turn warhorn data into signup sheets requires jinja2 be available.
